# Team Agreement

## Team Members
* Brandon Hurrington
* Manish B KC
* Marisha Hoza
* Peter Lee

### Communication Plan
* How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
  * 9:30am-5:00pm flexible depending on if issues occur. 
  * Slack to communicate after hours, but understand that team members may be busy and not able to respond.
  * Daily standup at 9:45am
  * Daily standup with TAs and Instructor 10:00am
  * Daily group retro at 4:45pm
* What is your strategy for ensuring everyone's voices are heard?
  * Allow everyone to share their point of view and vote on a solution. 
* How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
  * Creating an open space that allows everyone's voice to be heard. If someone is too quiet or not sharing ask them for their opinion and point of view. 

### Conflict Plan:
As a team, create a Group Agreement in order to document the following:
* What will your group do when it encounters conflict?
  * Polite conversation and efforts to de-escalate any aggression. 
* How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
  * With direct but polite feedback as a group, if our concerns are ignored we will escalate it to the teaching staff.
* How and when will you escalate the conflict if your attempts are unsuccessful?
  * If conflicts cannot be addressed within the group, the issue will be elevated to the Instructor.

### Work Plan:
As a team we will utilize a combination of Git Kraken and Glo Boards to track both tasks and work performed. We are splitting into two pairs, a front end team and a back end team, and will be tackling tasks in order of necessity on a daily basis. We will use our time at daily standup/retro to track progress, assign new tasks, and communicate what our needs and blocks are to one another.

### Git Process:
As a team we will utilize CLI/Git Kraken/Git Hub to manage version control and submit Pull Requests. We will make use of dev and prod environments and for PR review one other member not on the pair coding the given PR will review and sign off on the PR and merge it into the dev branch.
